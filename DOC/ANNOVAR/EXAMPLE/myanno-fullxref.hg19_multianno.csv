ISGylation involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving E1, E2, and E3 enzymes which catalyze the conjugation of ISG15 to a lysine residue in the target protein. Its target proteins include IFIT1, MX1/MxA, PPM1B, UBE2L6, UBA7, CHMP5, CHMP2A, CHMP4B and CHMP6. Can also isgylate: EIF2AK2/PKR which results in its activation, DDX58/RIG-I which inhibits its function in antiviral signaling response, EIF4E2 which enhances its cap structure-binding activity and translation- inhibition activity, UBE2N and UBE2E1 which negatively regulates their activity, IRF3 which inhibits its ubiquitination and degradation and FLNB which prevents its ability to interact with the upstream activators of the JNK cascade therby inhibiting IFNA- induced JNK signaling. Exhibits antiviral activity towards both DNA and RNA viruses, including influenza A, HIV-1 and Ebola virus. Restricts HIV-1 and ebola virus via disruption of viral budding. Inhibits the ubiquitination of HIV-1 Gag and host TSG101 and disrupts their interaction, thereby preventing assembly and release of virions from infected cells. Inhibits Ebola virus budding mediated by the VP40 protein by disrupting ubiquitin ligase activity of NEDD4 and its ability to ubiquitinate VP40. ISGylates influenza A virus NS1 protein which causes a loss of function of the protein and the inhibition of virus replication. The secreted form of ISG15 can: induce natural killer cell proliferation, act as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils and act as a IFN-gamma-inducing cytokine playing an essential role in antimycobacterial immunity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1373138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16009940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16112642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16428300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16434471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16872604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18305167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19270716, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19357168, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2005397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20133869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20308324, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20639253, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21543490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22693631, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22859821, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23229543, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7526157, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8550581}.; ","DISEASE: Immunodeficiency 38, with basal ganglia calcification (IMD38) [MIM:616126]: A primary immunodeficiency predisposing individuals to severe clinical disease upon infection with weakly virulent mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccines.

Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA- dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6- nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. More active on substrates containing 2 or 3 telomeric repeats. Telomerase activity is regulated by a number of factors including telomerase complex-associated proteins, chaperones and polypeptide modifiers. Modulates Wnt signaling. Plays important roles in aging and antiapoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14963003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15082768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15857955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17026956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17264120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17296728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17548608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19188162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19567472, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19777057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9389643}.; ","DISEASE: Note=Activation of telomerase has been implicated in cell immortalization and cancer cell pathogenesis.; DISEASE: Aplastic anemia (AA) [MIM:609135]: A form of anemia in which the bone marrow fails to produce adequate numbers of peripheral blood elements.

It arises during fetal lung development and is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome. The tumor contain both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Early in tumorigenesis, cysts form in lung airspaces, and these cysts are lined with benign-appearing epithelium. Mesenchymal cells susceptible to malignant transformation reside within the cyst walls and form a dense layer beneath the epithelial lining.
